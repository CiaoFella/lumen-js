# Interactive Video Player

## Overview

This JavaScript code creates an interactive video player experience. It allows users to play/pause the video by clicking on the video itself or a dedicated play button, and also provides a mute/unmute functionality through a separate sound button.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization (DOMContentLoaded):** The code executes after the entire page loads, setting up the video player interactions.
2. **Video Wrapper Selection:** It selects all elements with the `data-video="video-wrapper"` attribute, which represent the containers for the video players.
3. **Video Player Interaction:**
   - **Video Click:** Clicking on the video itself will play or pause the video, depending on its current state.
   - **Play Button:** If a play button is present (identified by `data-video="play-button"`), clicking it will toggle the video's play/pause state.
   - **Sound Button:** If a sound button is present (identified by `data-video="sound-button"`), clicking it will mute or unmute the video.

## Implementation

### HTML Structure

To use this interactive video player, your HTML should include the following structure:

```html
<div data-video="video-wrapper">
  <video data-video="video" src="path/to/your-video.mp4"></video>
  <button data-video="play-button">Play</button>
  <button data-video="sound-button">Mute/Unmute</button>
</div>
```

** Important Notes
* The code assumes that the video and button elements are structured as shown in the example.
* If no play button is present, the video will be toggled by clicking directly on it.
* If no sound button is present, the video's mute/unmute functionality will not be available.

## Customization
You can customize the following aspects:
* Video Source: Update the src attribute of the `<video>` element to point to your desired video file.
* Button Labels: Modify the text content of the play and sound buttons to suit your preferences.
* Button Styling: Apply your own CSS styles to the play and sound buttons to match the design of your website.

## Troubleshooting
If the interactive video player is not working as expected, consider the following:
1. HTML Structure: Ensure that your HTML elements have the correct data-video attributes and follow the specified structure.
2. Video Source: Verify that the src attribute of the `<video>` element points to a valid video file.
3. JavaScript Errors: Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the script from executing correctly.
4. Event Listeners: Confirm that the event listeners for the video, play button, and sound button are properly attached and functioning.
5. Video Playback: Test the video playback and mute/unmute functionality to ensure they are working as expected.
6. Browser Compatibility: Verify that the code works across different browsers and devices, as video playback support may vary.
